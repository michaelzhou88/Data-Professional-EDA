# Data-Professional-EDA
A small and fun project focused on analysing industry trends and identifying skill gaps in the data field. The goal was to provide actionable insights to help clients focus on high-demand skills and technologies.

First, I performed data cleaning and transformation using Power Query and DAX. This step was crucial to ensure the data we were working with was complete and valid, addressing any inconsistencies and filling gaps as necessary.

Once the data was prepared, I moved on to the analysis phase. Here, I identified key trends in the data analytics and data science job market. For example, I looked at the growth in demand for specific skills like machine learning, Python, and cloud computing. I also analysed satisfaction scores and demographic breakdowns to provide a comprehensive view of the job market landscape.

To present my findings, I created interactive dashboards using PowerBI. These dashboards included various visualizations that made it easy to understand the satisfaction scores and demographic breakdowns. The interactive nature of the dashboards allowed stakeholders to explore the data in more depth and tailor the insights to their specific interests.
